Build a privacy-first decentralized application (dApp) called SolCipher for secure, end-to-end encrypted document and file sharing between Hedera wallets. The app should integrate client-side encryption, decentralized storage on IPFS, and on-chain access control using Hedera Hashgraph. Use Next.js and React for the frontend, with seamless wallet integration via HashPack or Blade wallets. Ensure the app follows Web3 best practices for decentralization, transparency, and user ownership.
Key features:
End-to-end encryption using AES-256-GCM via the Web Crypto API, performed entirely client-side before upload.
Decentralized storage on IPFS using Web3.Storage to ensure data availability, immutability, and tamper-resistance (files broken into chunks with unique Content Identifiers or CIDs).
On-chain permissions and expiries managed by Solidity smart contracts deployed on Hedera (e.g., functions for sharing documents, revoking access, and viewing files).
Integration with Hedera services: Hedera File Service (HFS) for storing file hashes and metadata immutably, Hedera Consensus Service (HCS) for timestamped, tamper-proof logging of share/expiry/revocation events, and optional Hedera Token Service (HTS) for tokenized access control.
Batch file uploads with auto-expiry and revocation capabilities.
User interface for connecting wallets, uploading/sharing files, setting expiry timers, revoking access, and retrieving/decrypting shared files.
Support for low-cost HBAR transactions for network fees during operations like contract interactions.

Architecture flow:
User encrypts file locally (AES-256-GCM).
Encrypted file uploaded to IPFS, generating a CID.
CID and permissions recorded in Hedera smart contract.
Event logged via HCS for transparency.
Recipient retrieves CID from contract, downloads from IPFS, and decrypts locally using their key.

Backend/utils:
Use Ethers.js for smart contract interactions.
Hedera SDK for HFS and HCS operations.
Implement encryption/decryption in JavaScript utils.

Security requirements (incorporate these to address potential risks):
Use secure key derivation with Argon2 (memory=64MB, iterations=3) for any password-based keys; never store keys in persistent browser storage like localStorage—keep in runtime memory only.
Generate unique nonces for each AES-256-GCM encryption using a cryptographically secure random generator (CSPRNG).
In smart contracts: Use OpenZeppelin libraries for ReentrancyGuard and Ownable to prevent reentrancy attacks and ensure proper access control (e.g., onlyOwner modifiers on critical functions like revokeAccess).
Handle external calls safely (check returns from call() and delegatecall()), avoid integer overflows (use Solidity >=0.8.0), and make fallback functions non-payable.
Frontend: Enforce robust input validation to prevent XSS/CSRF/injection; apply Content Security Policy (CSP), Subresource Integrity (SRI), and strict CORS for whitelisted origins.
Use secure wallet providers (e.g., HashPack) for transaction signing to avoid local key exposure.
Enforce TLS 1.3 with certificate validation for all communications (client-IPFS-Hedera).
Implement rate limiting and DDoS protection for any gateways; pin dependencies and scan for supply-chain risks.
Ensure no plaintext or keys are transmitted over the network; clear browser memory after operations to minimize session hijack risks.

Deployment:
Deploy smart contracts via Hardhat to Hedera testnet first, then mainnet after testing.
Frontend hosted with npm run dev for development.

Make the app user-friendly for professionals in legal, healthcare, or finance sectors, with a clean UI for wallet connection, file management, and activity logs. Include documentation or tooltips explaining Web3 concepts like Hedera, IPFS, and smart contracts for new users. Ensure the app is carbon-negative by leveraging Hedera's energy-efficient design.
Finally, generate the full codebase, including root dependencies, client folder, contracts, scripts (e.g., deploy-testnet.sh), and .env setup for Hedera testnet ID/keys. Test for no serious vulnerabilities as per OWASP Web3 Top 10 and STRIDE threat modeling.7 web pagescreate some words to explain this project as present in hedera hakthonThought for 11sSolCipher is a groundbreaking privacy-first decentralized application (dApp) built on the Hedera Hashgraph network, designed to revolutionize secure document sharing in the Web3 era. Imagine a world where you can share sensitive files—like legal contracts, medical records, or financial statements—with complete confidence, knowing they're protected by end-to-end encryption and decentralized controls that no central authority can tamper with.
At its core, SolCipher addresses the critical challenges of data breaches and unauthorized access in traditional centralized platforms. Users encrypt files client-side using robust AES-256-GCM encryption before uploading them to IPFS for immutable, decentralized storage. Access permissions, expirations, and revocations are managed on-chain via Solidity smart contracts deployed on Hedera, ensuring transparency and auditability. We integrate Hedera's powerful services: the File Service for storing hashes and metadata, the Consensus Service for tamper-proof logging of events, and optional Token Service for tokenized access—all powered by low-cost HBAR transactions.
Key features include batch uploads, auto-expiry timers to automatically revoke access after a set period, and seamless wallet integration with tools like HashPack or Blade. This makes it ideal for professionals in healthcare, finance, and legal sectors who need compliance, privacy, and efficiency without the risks of single-point failures seen in tools like Dropbox or DocuSign.
What sets SolCipher apart in the Hedera ecosystem? It's faster and cheaper than Ethereum-based alternatives, thanks to Hedera's high-throughput DAG consensus, and it's eco-friendly with a carbon-negative footprint. Our frontend is built with Next.js and React for a user-friendly experience, while the backend leverages Ethers.js and the Hedera SDK for secure operations.
In this hackathon, we're showcasing not just innovation but resilience: A recent pentest report by cybersecurity expert Wessam Al-Khushman validates our architecture against OWASP Web3 Top 10 threats, highlighting strong cryptographic practices and vulnerability mitigations. Looking ahead, we plan mainnet deployment, beta testing, feature expansions like multi-recipient sharing, and pursuing Hedera grants to scale.
